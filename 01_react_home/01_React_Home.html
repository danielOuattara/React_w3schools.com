<!--
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single page applications.
React allows to create reusable UI components.


What You Should Already Know
=============================

Before starting with React.JS, you should have intermediate experience
in:
    > HTML
    > CSS
    > JavaScript

You should also have some experience with the new JavaScript features
introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), you will learn about them in the
React ES6 chapter.


Learning by Examples
======================

Our "Show React" tool makes it easy to demonstrate React,
it shows both the code and the result.

_____________________________________________________________

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById('root'));
______________________________________________________________


Create React App
=================

In order to learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment
on your computer.

This tutorial uses the 'create-react-app'. It is an officially
supported way to create React applications.

'npm' and 'Node.js' are required to create a React
application.

Run this command to create a React application named 'myfirstreact': 

npx create-react-app myfirstreact

The 'create-react-app' will set up everything you need to run a React
application.

Note: This tutorial uses 'create-react-app' to demonstrate React
      examples. You will not be able to run the same examples on
      your computer if you  do not install the create-react-app
      environment.


Run the React Application
==========================

If you followed the two commands above, you are ready to run your
first real React application!

Run this command to move to the myfirstreact directory:
___________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name>cd myfirstreact

Run this command to execute the React application 'myfirstreact':
_________________________________________
C:\Users\Your Name\myfirstreact>npm start

A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App!
If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar. -->
