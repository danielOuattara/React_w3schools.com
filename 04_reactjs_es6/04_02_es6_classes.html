React ES6 Classes


Classes
===========

ES6 introduced classes.

A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword 
function to initiate it, we use the keyword 'class', and its properties 
are assigned inside a 'constructor()' method.


A simple class constructor:


class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}

Notice the case of the class name: 
-----------------------------------

We have begun the name, "Car", with an uppercase character. 
This is a standard naming convention for classes.

Now you can create objects using the Car class:

Create an object called "mycar" based on the Car class:


class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}

mycar = new Car("Ford");

Note: The 'constructor' function is called automatically 
      when the object is initialized.


Method in Classes
====================

You can add your own methods in a class:

Create a method named "present":


class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }
}

mycar = new Car("Ford");
mycar.present();


As you can see in the example above, you call the method by 
referring to the object's method name followed by parentheses 
(parameters would go inside the parentheses).


Class Inheritance
===================

To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.
A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods 
from another class:

Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the 
"Car" class:


class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }

  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }
}


class Model extends Car {
  constructor(name, mod) {
    super(name);
    this.model = mod;
  }  
  show() {
      return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
  }
}

mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
mycar.show();


The 'super()' method refers to the parent class.

By calling the 'super()' method in the constructor method, 
we call the parent's constructor method and gets access 
to the parent's properties and methods.
