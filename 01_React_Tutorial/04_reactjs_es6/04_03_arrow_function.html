    React ES6 Arrow Functions

Arrow Functions
=================

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

Before:
-------

hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}

With Arrow Function:
--------------------

hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}

It gets shorter! 

If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, 
you can remove the brackets and the return keyword

Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:
----------------------------------------

hello = () => "Hello World!";

Note: This works only if the function has only one statement.


If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:

Arrow Function With Parameters:
-------------------------------

hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;

In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip
 the parentheses as well:

Arrow Function Without Parentheses:
------------------------------------

hello = val => "Hello " + val;


What About this?
================

The handling of 'this' is also different in arrow functions compared 
to regular functions.

In short, with arrow functions there are no binding of 'this'.

-> In regular functions the 'this' keyword represented the object that 
   called the function, which could be the window, the document, 
   a button or whatever.

-> With arrow functions, the 'this' keyword always represents the object 
   that defined, that owns the arrow function.


Let us take a look at two examples to understand the difference.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Both examples call a method twice, first when the page loads, 
and once again when the user clicks a button.

- the first example uses a regular function,
- the second example uses an arrow function.

The results:
 - the first example returns two different objects(window and button)
 - the second example returns the Header object twice.


With a regular function, 'this' represents the object that called 
the function:


class Header {
  constructor() {
    this.color = "Red";
  }

  changeColor = function() {  //Regular function:
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
  }
}

myheader = new Header();

//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", myheader.changeColor);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", myheader.changeColor);
 

// =======>

With an arrow function, 'this' represents the Header object no matter 
who called the function:


class Header {
  constructor() {
    this.color = "Red";
  }

//Arrow function:
  changeColor = () => {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
  }
}

myheader = new Header();


//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", myheader.changeColor);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", myheader.changeColor);
 

Remember these differences when you are working with functions. Sometimes the behavior of regular functions is what you want, if not, use arrow functions.
