<!-- 
    React ES6 Modules

Modules
==========

JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.

This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.

ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.
-----------------------------------------------------

Export
==========

You can export a function or variable from any file.

Let us create a file named 'person.js', and fill it with the things 
we want to export.

There are two types of exports: 'Named' and 'Default'.


Named Exports
================

You can create named exports in two ways: 
- In-line individually
- all at once at the bottom.


In-line individually:
-----------------------

in person.js

export const name = "Jesse";
export const age = "40";


All at once at the bottom:
---------------------------

in person.js

const name = "Jesse";
const age = "40";

export { name, age };


Default Exports
==================

Let us create another file, named 'message.js', and use it for 
demonstrating default export.

You can only have one default export in a file.

in message.js

const message = () => {
  const name = "Jesse";
  const age = "40";
  return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
};

export default message;



Import
========

You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are :
- named exports 
- default exports.


= Named exports must be destructured using curly braces. 
= Default exports do not need to.

=> Import from named exports (Import named exports from the file person.js)

import { name, age } from "./person.js";

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Import from default exports (Import a default export from the file message.js)

import message from "./message.js";
